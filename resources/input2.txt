It is strongly recommended to use the latest release version of Apache Maven to take advantage of newest features and bug fixes.

If you still want to use an old version, you can find more information in the Maven Releases History and can download files from 
the Maven 3 archives for versions 3.0.4+ and legacy archives for earlier releases.
